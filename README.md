## How It Works

1. **API Key Setup**: Gemini API key is loaded from environment variables
2. **Student Context**: App displays Riya's profile information
3. **Query Processing**: User types questions about studies
4. **AI Processing**: Gemini AI processes queries with student context and mentor system prompt
5. **Personalized Response**: AI provides tailored advice based on Riya's profile
6. **Local Storage**: Chat history is automatically saved and restored

## System Prompt

The AI mentor uses this system prompt:

> "You are a personalized student mentor chatbot. You know about the student's schedule, marks, hobbies, likes, dislikes, and personal description. Always ground your responses in the retrieved student data. If the data does not include something, give polite general advice. Be supportive, encouraging, and practical."

## Example Interactions

**User**: "How should I plan my weekend?"

**AI Response**: "Hi Riya! Based on your schedule and interests, I'd suggest balancing your weekend between catching up on History (your weakest subject at 65%) and enjoying your hobbies. Since you prefer interactive learning over long lectures, try using educational apps or group study sessions for History review. You could also incorporate some cricket or reading time as rewards after study sessions. Don't forget to keep up with your dance practice since it's such an important part of your routine!"
